PROJECT DESCRIPTION :  Personal-Portfolio

It demonstrates the individual’s technical abilities, design sense, and personal style, acting as a first impression for potential employers, clients, or collaborators.

Learning Outcomes
      Through this task, interns practice structuring HTML elements semantically, styling them with CSS, and using responsive design techniques like media queries or flexible layouts. They also learn about personal branding and the importance of presenting their work professionally online.
      The project encourages creativity — interns can choose their own color schemes, typography, layout style, and images. This freedom lets them express their personality and build a unique online identity.
      
Deliverable and Certification
      Upon successful completion of this task, interns are required to submit their portfolio as per CodTech’s guidelines. The deliverable is a clean, working single-page portfolio site with functional navigation. Once all internship tasks are completed, CodTech will issue a Completion Certificate, validating the intern’s learning journey and practical experience.
